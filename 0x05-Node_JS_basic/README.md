# 0x05-Node_JS_basic

In this project, we will be learning the basics of Node.js, a powerful and popular server-side JavaScript platform.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, we should be able to:

-   Understand the basics of Node.js
-   Create a simple HTTP server with Node.js
-   Use the built-in http and fs modules in Node.js
-   Use Express.js to create more advanced HTTP servers
-   Understand and use ES6 features in Node.js

## Requirements

-   Node.js 14.x
-   NPM

## Installation

To install this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone `https://github.com/your-username/0x05-Node_JS_basic.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 0x05-Node_JS_basic`
3. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

To run any of the scripts in this project, use the node command followed by the filename. For example, to run `0-hello_world.js`, use:

`node 0-hello_world.js`

To run the HTTP server examples, use:

`node 1-http.js`

or

`node 2-http.js`

or

`npm run dev`

This will start the server on port 5000.
