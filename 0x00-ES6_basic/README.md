# ES6 Basics Project

![Header Image](js.png)

This project is a collection of JavaScript files focusing on ES6 features and concepts. It includes exercises covering various ES6 topics, such as arrow functions, template literals, spread syntax, and iterators.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into different files, each addressing a specific ES6 concept. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Block Scope**: Demonstrates the use of block scope in JavaScript, avoiding variable hoisting issues.

2. **Arrow Functions**: Rewrites functions using the ES6 arrow syntax to make the code more concise and readable.

3. **Parameter Defaults**: Condenses function internals using default parameter values.

4. **Rest Parameter Syntax**: Modifies a function to return the number of arguments passed using the rest parameter syntax.

5. **Spread Syntax**: Concatenates arrays and strings using the spread syntax.

6. **Template Literals**: Utilizes template literals to enhance string interpolation and variable substitution.

7. **Object Property Value Shorthand**: Simplifies the creation of objects by using ES6 object property value shorthand syntax.

8. **Computed Property Names**: Updates a function to use ES6 computed property names when creating an object.

9. **ES6 Method Properties**: Refactors a function to use ES6 method properties in an object.

10. **For...of Loops**: Converts a for...in loop to a for...of loop for better iteration over arrays.

11. **Iterator**: Implements a function that creates an object with an iterator to iterate over employees in different departments.

12. **Create Report Object**: Generates a report object containing information about employees and their departments.

13. **Create Iterator Object**: Creates an iterator object to iterate through employees in different departments.

14. **Iterate Through Object**: Produces a string containing names of all employees, separated by '|'.

## Usage
Each JavaScript file corresponds to a specific task and can be executed individually. For example:

```
node 1-block-scoped.js
```
Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine before running the scripts.

Feel free to explore each task to understand and practice ES6 concepts.
