# TypeScript Project: ALX Backend JavaScript

This project is part of the ALX Backend JavaScript curriculum, focusing on learning and implementing TypeScript. The project is divided into several tasks, each aimed at teaching different TypeScript features and concepts.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand basic types in TypeScript
- Use interfaces, classes, and functions
- Work with the DOM using TypeScript
- Implement generic types
- Utilize namespaces
- Merge declarations
- Import external libraries using ambient namespaces
- Apply basic nominal typing with TypeScript

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/fazzy12/alx-backend-javascript.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd alx-backend-javascript/0x04-TypeScript
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

## Tasks Overview

1. **Creating an interface for a student**: Define a `Student` interface and render a table with student information.
2. **Building a Teacher interface**: Create a `Teacher` interface and handle additional unspecified attributes.
3. **Extending the Teacher class**: Extend the `Teacher` interface to include a `Directors` interface.
4. **Printing teachers**: Implement a `printTeacher` function to format and return a teacher's name.
5. **Writing a class**: Define a `StudentClass` with specific methods and describe it through interfaces.
6. **Advanced types Part 1**: Implement interfaces and classes for `Director` and `Teacher` with specific methods.
7. **Creating functions specific to employees**: Create type-specific functions for `Director` and `Teacher`.
8. **String literal types**: Define a string literal type `Subjects` and a `teachClass` function.
9. **Ambient Namespaces**: Use ambient namespaces for managing external libraries and define interfaces for database operations.
10. **Namespace & Declaration merging**: Implement classes and interfaces within the `Subjects` namespace and merge declarations.
11. **Brand convention & Nominal typing**: Implement nominal typing with `MajorCredits` and `MinorCredits` interfaces, and define functions to sum credits.
